    <p>A fascinating tour around the world of hidden signals and communication by Sweden's 
        foremost mentalist. Use this wisely!' - Derren Brown Learning to mind read isn't as 
        out there as it may sound. In every interaction we have, we give away a range of non-verbal 
        signals, often more powerful than the words we say. The Art of Reading Minds teaches you 
        how to influence others, bringing them round to your way of thinking. Rooted in cognitive 
        psychology, Henrik Fexeus explains how readers can find out what another person feels - 
        and consequently control that individual's thoughts and beliefs. Short, snappy chapters 
        cover subjects like: Contradictory signs and what they mean How you flirt with people 
        without even knowing it Methods of suggestion and undetectable influence How to plant 
        and trigger emotional states Fexeus offers practical tips to master the art of persuasion, 
        which will boost your confidence both in personal and professional settings. 
        Simple exercises throughout the book will heighten your self-awareness, revealing how you 
        are perceived by others. Whether you want to get a promotion, negotiate a pay rise, network 
        like a pro, find romance or spot when someone is lying, The Art of Reading Minds shows you 
        how to uncover what people are really saying. 'If you ever wanted to know how a mentalist 
        can tell what is in your mind, then this is the book for you.' - Joe Navarro, author of 
        the international bestseller What Every Body is Saying.
