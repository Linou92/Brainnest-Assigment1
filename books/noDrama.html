    <p>The pioneering experts behind the bestselling The Whole-Brain Child now explore the ultimate 
        child-raising challenge: discipline. A breakfast bowl gets thrown across the kitchen, 
        splattering milk and cereal all over the wall. Or one of your kids threatens a younger sibling. 
        Or you get a call from the headteacher's office for the third time this month. What do you do? 
        No-Drama Discipline provides an effective, compassionate road map for dealing with such 
        tantrums, tensions, and tears - without causing a scene. Based on recent discoveries about 
        the brain that give us deep insights into the children we care for, what they need, and how 
        to discipline them in ways that foster optimal development, this book offers a 'relational' 
        approach that builds on children's innate desire to please their parents and get along well 
        with others. Complete with candid stories and playful illustrations that bring the authors' 
        suggestions to life, No-Drama Discipline presents clear messages in a practical and inviting 
        format. Using these techniques, you can discipline your children in a way that's high on 
        relationship-building, high on respect, and low on drama and conflict. As a result, your 
        life as a parent will be easier, and your parenting will become more effective. 
        And more importantly, you'll create connections in your children's brains to build emotional 
        and social skills that will serve them now and throughout their entire life - all while 
        strengthening your relationship with them.
