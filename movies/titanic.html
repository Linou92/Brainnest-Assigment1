    <p>Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, produced, 
        and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, 
        it is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and 
        Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during 
        its ill-fated maiden voyage. Also starring are Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, 
        Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton.
        Cameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; 
        he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the 
        emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995, when Cameron 
        shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were 
        shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming 
        the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic 
        built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by 
        Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America 
        while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever 
        made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million.
