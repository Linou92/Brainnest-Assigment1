    <p>Beauty and the Beast is a 2017 American musical romantic fantasy film directed by 
        Bill Condon from a screenplay by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos. Co-produced 
        by Walt Disney Pictures and Mandeville Films, the film is a live action adaptation 
        of Disney's 1991 animated film of the same name, itself an adaptation of Jeanne-Marie 
        Leprince de Beaumont's 1756 version of the fairy tale.Led by Emma Watson and Dan 
        Stevens as the eponymous Belle and the Beast, the film features an ensemble and choir 
        cast including Luke Evans, Kevin Kline, Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Audra 
        McDonald, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson.
        A live-action Beauty and the Beast remake was first announced in April 2014, with Condon
        hired to direct it; Watson, Stevens, Evans, and the rest of the cast signed on between 
        January and April 2015. Filming took place primarily at Shepperton Studios in England from 
        May to August 2015. With an estimated budget of around $255 million, it is one of the most 
        expensive films ever made.
