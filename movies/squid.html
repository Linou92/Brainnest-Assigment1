    <p>Squid Game (Korean: 오징어 게임; RR: Ojing-eo Geim) is a South Korean survival drama television 
        series created by Hwang Dong-hyuk for Netflix. Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, 
        Wi Ha-joon, HoYeon Jung, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi, and Kim Joo-ryoung.
        The series revolves around a contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial 
        hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win 
        a ₩45.6 billion (US$35 million, €33 million, or £29 million as of broadcast) prize. 
        The title of the series draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang had 
        conceived of the idea based on his own economic struggles early in life, as well as the 
        class disparity in South Korea and capitalism. Though he had initially written it in 2009, 
        he was unable to find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest 
        around 2019 as part of their drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.
